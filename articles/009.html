                    Our mother, Planet Earth, is slowly dying and it showing us clear signs that are being communicated through nature. Even though our efforts to preserve
                    the Planet are very serious, they are practically ineffective. The global warming and pollution problems are rising at a rapid rate and the amount of
                    pure drinkable water is shrinking at an unfathomable rate. Without clean drinking water, life on Earth will stop thriving. New problems that threaten
                    human extinction rise every year such as extinction through meteor collision. To solve these problems, tech billionaires and government funded
                    organizations have started working on projects to help human civilization colonize other planets.

                    <h3>History of Mars</h3>
                    <p>Around four billion years ago, Mars is rumored to harbor thriving environments where life may have survived and evolved. However, due to meteor collisions
                    and the already-thin atmosphere, the surface was destroyed and radiation from the sun broke down the atmosphere and killed all life on Mars. It hasn't been
                    proven if life on Mars ever existed since we aren't able to find any fossils but there is strong evidence proving Earth to have rivers and oceans of liquid
                    water just like our planet Earth once had. The water on Mars has now frozen and accumulated on the ice caps in the North and South regions of the planet
                    (furthest from the Sun).</p>

                    <h3>SpaceX Terraforming Planet Mars</h3>
                    <p>Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, has worked on countless missions including the Falcon 9 and now SpaceX is finally working towards building the Starship
                    rockets. These rockets have revolutionized space travel because Starship is designed to be a fully reusable and orbital rocket which reduces lunch costs
                    and maintenance between flights. This allows for easy transportation of multiple humans at a time. The Starship rocket will be able to carry tons of weight
                    out of Earth's strong gravitation pull by using a super heavy booster powered by Raptor and Raptor Vacuum engines. Falcon 9 is designed to life cargo in
                    and out of Planet which is perfect to transport materials over to Mars to build bases.</p>
                    <p>To be able to fully terraform Mars and make it safe for human colonization, the process is very long and tedious. First, let's check though what
                    the Planet Mars is missing for life to be able to thrive. Unlike Earth, Mars doesn't have a thick enough atmosphere that we humans can breathe with
                    and the thin atmosphere also doesn't block enough radiation which threatens cancer for all humans on Mars. So, we will need to artificially create an
                    atmosphere on Mars by importing gases such as Oxygen, Nitrogen, and Carbon Dioxide for the atmosphere. Mars also doesn't have any water or soil to grow
                    plants. Melting Mars' surface into oceans of lava, will melt the ice caps to produce liquid water and also replenish the soil with a lot of nutrients from
                    Mars' surface. We can install an artificial magnetic field by placing 2 magnets across the rotational axis of Mars.<br>
                    To learn about the extreme process of terraforming Mars, check out this <a href="https://youtu.be/HpcTJW4ur54">Kurzgesagt video</a>!</p>
                    <p>Elon Musk says he is willing to set off nuclear bombs on the Planet Mars to replenish the soil and melt the ice caps to bring back some water on Mars.
                    This however, sounds extremely dangerous because if the radiation leaves Mars and leaks into outer-space it will be a huge problem for humans in the
                    future.</p>

                    <h3>NASA Artemis Missions Moon Base</h3>
                    <p>Generally speaking, the goals of Artemis are to enable scientific discovery, open up new economic opportunities, and inspire a new generation of
                    scientists, technologists, and leaders. However, the real specific goals of the Artemis missions are to find water on the moon and other resources that
                    support long-term space exploration.</p>
                    <p>NASA launched Artemis 1 on November 2022 in hopes of sending materials to the moon in order to be able to create the first ever moon base. The idea
                    behind constructing the Artemis Base Camp is to be able to build a surface habitat so that astronauts can remain on the moon's surface for days or
                    even weeks, to collect samples and data for further research. NASA, is finally sending humans back to the lunar surface for the first time in 50 years. But
                    this time the astronauts are building a moon base, so they can do more than just moon walks like the Apollo astronauts did.<br>
                    Researchers will run multiple experiments, measure plant growth with intense radiation from the sun, measure plant growth without gravity. Since the moon's
                    motion is a lot faster than the Earth, time will run a lot slower as well. Since the time on the moon is a lot slower and since the moon experiences
                    eclipses from the Sun quite often, it will be hard to grow plants with minimal sunlight. Researchers will need to use artificial light and heat sources on
                    the moon to be able to survive. The lunar soil has also been tested on Earth from the samples brought from the moon and proves that plants can be grown
                    using Lunar soil.</p>
                    <p>Not only does this huge achievement in space exploration help in conducting long-term research on the moon, but it also takes us one step closer
                    to figuring out how to colonize other planets or celestial bodies in our solar system. This advancement created a break-through in planetary colonization
                    and will definitely advance human scientific discovery immensely.</p>
